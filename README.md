## Hello, My name is **Dominik** - aka SnowyCocoon

### I'm a **Game Developer, Game Designer, Programmer, and AI specialist** and currently working in Knoocker, Hikari and partly on my own "Perfumex" project
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Data Science/AI portfolio. I'm creating a trading bot, perfume recomendation site, and a game bot right now.
- ðŸŒ± I wrote my engineering thesis about the differences between Godot and Unity engines, and my master's thesis about voice recognition in games.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm always open to new ideas and job offers (as long as I'm partially free).
- ðŸ¥… 2023/2024 Goals: Learn more about the scientific side of VTubing and find a new Job in Data Science.
- âš¡ Hobbies: I love all kinds of sports and Japanese literature (especially Dazai and Mishima). I'm also a DotA2, Diablo 3/4 and OSRS Player.
